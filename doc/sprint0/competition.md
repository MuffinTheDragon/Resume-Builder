### Existing Products

* ResumeIO (Paid, a lot of templates) (Url: https://resume.io/ )
* EnhanCV (Paid, templates focus on tech companies) (Url: https://enhancv.com/)

### How our product different?

* It’s **free** compared to most competitors (i.e. Resume.io charges $15/month)
* Our resume builder takes **previous knowledge** from past students who have gotten into **Big N companies from UofT**
* Tailored towards **UTM PEY/intern students** (Our resume builder will follow the PEY recommended guidelines) 
* Currently, a lot of the resume builders focus on full time opportunities rather than recent graduates and internships
* We have **specific templates** for students with and without internship experience (i.e. We’re trying to break the deadlock of, “Students trying to get job experience but in order to get the job, they need prior job experience”)

### Why do we think competitors didn’t focus on these users and/or scenarios? And what would it take from them to do so?
* Trying to make profit instead of focusing on helping students
* It’s hard for websites such as Resume.io to encompass all fields of study => a lot of **generic templates** are used (It’s difficult to centralize the specifics for every job you’re going for when making a resume)
* By focusing on **specialized templates** for CS => It will reduce their overall potential target audience as well as their profit
