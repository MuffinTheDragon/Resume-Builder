## How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?

- Team Organization
    - We split the team based on Frontend and Backend
        - Members were "distributed" based on where their strenghts lie in
        - Discord tags (Frontend and Backend) were given to the members of each respective team
- We filled out a when2meet and agreed upon a common time
- Tools used:
    - Discord (Communication)
    - Google Docs (Sprint0)
    - Reminder Bot (Announce 30 mins before a meeting)

## How did you make decisions?
We voted on the project idea that we liked the most (Majority wins). This was done through several rounds of voting.

## How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? 
- Given the overall project idea that we wanted, we listed out the main components that are required as well as their overall level of difficulty
    - We assigned weightings (1 easiest - 10 hardest) on the user stories and took an overall average to determine priority. (We used the Scrum Poker method to determine overall weightings)
    
## How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?
- Around 3 rounds of voting were done to come to a consensus

## How frequently did you meet?
- 3 times a week (Mon, Wed, Fri) and occasionally Sat

## What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
- As a team most of our time was spent brainstorming and pitching ideas or suggestions rather than doing actual group work together during meeting times. To combat this, we should be more decisive, and voice our opinions if we have strong feelings one way or another on a suggestion or aspect of the project.
