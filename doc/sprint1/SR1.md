## Unfinished Tasks

- All tasks assigned for this sprin were completed

## What are practices that you should continue during next sprint

- PR reviews with multiple reviewers to allow others to be caught up
  Communicating changes to other teammates (either on Discord or with Jira)
- Using Jira's Work log to document and compare predicted user story difficulty and time required to complete them
- Adding photo previews of your work when creating the pull request

## What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint

- Group work sessions to maximize productivity
- Add linter to code to standardize coding practices & formatting
- Allot 1-2 days at the end of the sprint to refactor all code

## What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint

- Not giving ample amount of time for multiple group members to evaluate pull requests
- Not giving ample amount of time to consolidate/refactor code from multiple group members' different tasks

## What was your best/worst experience during sprint 1?

**Best**: We have a visual product of what we have completed this sprint, and the honour of our TA reading this ;)

**Worst**: Struggling to find time to work on this sprint between all of our other courses due to overlapping assignment due dates.
