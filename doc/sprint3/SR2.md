## Unfinished Tasks

- All tasks assigned for this sprint were completed

## What are practices that you should continue during next sprint

- PR reviews with multiple reviewers to allow others to be caught up
  Communicating changes to other teammates (either on Discord or with Jira)
- Using Jira's Work log to document and compare predicted user story difficulty and time required to complete them
- Adding photo previews of your work when creating the pull request
- Group work sessions to maximize productivity
- Allot 1-2 days at the end of the sprint to refactor all code

## What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint

- Add linter to code to standardize coding practices & formatting
- Split up tasks on Jira in a more efficient and effective way

## What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint

- Not giving ample amount of time for multiple group members to evaluate pull requests
- Not giving ample amount of time to consolidate/refactor code from multiple group members' different tasks
- Making tasks on Jira too large with too many subtasks

## What was your best/worst experience during sprint 2?

**Best**: Team bonding over reading week! But also getting resume rendering to work where input fields update the resume preview :)

**Worst**: Dealing with how to split up Jira tasks and branches because the Jira tasks started out too large...
