## Unfinished Tasks

- All tasks assigned for this sprint were completed

## What are practices that you should continue during next sprint

- PR reviews with multiple reviewers to allow others to be caught up
  Communicating changes to other teammates (either on Discord or with Jira)
- Using Jira's Work log to document and compare predicted user story difficulty and time required to complete them
- Adding photo previews of your work when creating the pull request
- Group work sessions to maximize productivity
- Splitting up Jira tasks into smaller tasks

## What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint

- Add linter to code to standardize coding practices & formatting

## What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint

- Not giving ample amount of time for multiple group members to evaluate pull requests
- Not giving ample amount of time to consolidate/refactor code from multiple group members' different tasks

## What was your best/worst experience during sprint 2?

**Best**: Team bonding and playing Super Seducer and learning that if they don't have a SteamID you shouldn't try and seduce them

**Worst**: Running low on time for the sprint because there were other assignments due
